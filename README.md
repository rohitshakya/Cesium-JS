Cesium JS
## Setup
Just a few setup steps before we can get to development.

Make sure your system is Cesium compatible by visiting [Cesium Viewer](https://cesium.com/cesiumjs/cesium-viewer/).  
Install Node.js.  
Get the workshop code. Either clone or download the zip and extract the contents.  
In your console, navigate to the root cesium-workshop directory.  
Run npm install cesium.  
Run npm start.
